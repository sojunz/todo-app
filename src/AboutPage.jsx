      <p>
        To‑do lists are for everyone—students, professionals, and creators. 
        They help us capture tasks, organize life, and turn small steps into progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website follows that tradition, but with a unique touch: 
        it speaks especially to learners and makers who blend productivity with creativity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, tasks are not just items to check off—they become part of a journey of growth, 
        a quiet rhythm of learning, building, and handmade warmth.
